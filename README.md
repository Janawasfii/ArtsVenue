Developed a system that allows artists to showcase their artwork for sale or simply display it to the public. Additionally, the system offers the ability for artists to rent galleries, enabling them to organize their own exhibitions and professionally present their artwork. This solution helps artists reach a broader audience and organize the display of their work in a way that suits their artistic and commercial needs.
